// This small example will build a target with redis and nginx. A pretty
// pointless setup, but good enough to demonstrate features.
//
// In urknall we will build a target with a package. The machine
// that is to be set up automatically is called target. The package is a specification of what
// should be set up and how. This is a three layer architecture:
// - commands are the atoms, the stuff actually executed on the target (think
//   of it as shell commands).
// - a task is an ordered list of commands. It has a caching mechanism
//   built in that determines for any command whether it has been
//   executed previously (in that case it won't be executed again). This
//   prevents the system from doing stuff over and over again. If a
//   command changes, all following commands of the ordered list of commands will be executed
//   again.
// - a package is a container of tasks and other packages. It is used to
//   structure projects.
// Neither tasks nor packages are generate by the user. Instead users are encouraged to
// create PackageBuilders and TaskBuilders that add things to given tasks or packages (or targets ?).
