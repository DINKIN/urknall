package cmd

// The Commander interface must be implemented by the different command types. It is used to run the command in
// different contexts, i.e. either shell, docker, or logging. The last one comes in handy if a command's underlying as
// some command's doings are rather lengthy or cryptic, but the intent is described easily (like writing assets or
// file).
type Commander interface {
	Docker() string  // Used for executing the action in a docker context.
	Shell() string   // Used for executing the action in a shell (locally or via ssh).
	Logging() string // Get string used for logging.
