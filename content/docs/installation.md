# Installation

To install urknall a proper go setup is required. See
[go](http://www.golang.org) for further information on how to do so. This page
has a helpful [tour](http://tour.golang.org/#1) on the language itself that
might be a good quick introduction, when you haven't use go yet.

Installation of urknall is as easy as running the following command:

	#!shell
	$ go get github.com/dynport/urknall/urknall

This will download the source to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/dynport/urknall` and
install the [urknall binary](../binary/) to `$GOPATH/bin` (which should be in your
`$PATH` environment for best experience) and [urknall library](../library/) to the
subtree in `$GOPATH/pkg`.
